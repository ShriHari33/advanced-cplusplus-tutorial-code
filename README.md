# Advanced C++ Bo Qian tutorial Code

This repo contains the code that I played around with while following along the Advanced C++ tutorial by Bo Qian on Youtube. The code here is not exactly the same as shown in the vidoes, it might contain code that I have experimented with for my own understanding. Exact code for the videos in the tutorial is available on Bo Qian's website http://boqian.weebly.com/c-programming.html. Maybe someone will find this repository helpful, so I put it on github.

## Getting Started

You just need a C++ compiler with C++11 support, a good IDE and some willingness to code ;)
I used MinGW with codeblocks, works fine. There are plenty of comments in the code so that you can play around yourself. The filenames will tell you about the topics covered in each .cpp file.
